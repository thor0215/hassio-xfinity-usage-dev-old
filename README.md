# Home Assistant Addon to fetch Xfinity Internet Usage Data

Fetch Xfinity Internet Service Usage Data and publish it to a Home Assistant sensor. The Python code logic was originally based on [zachowj/xfinity-data-usage](https://github.com/zachowj/xfinity-data-usage) and uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/).

## Setup

### This addon will not work if your Xfinity account is using MFA

1. Add this repository `https://github.com/thor0215/hassio-xfinity-usage-dev` to Home Assistant as a source for third-party addons. See the [Home Assistant documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os#installing-third-party-add-ons) if you have questions on how to do that. You can also use the button below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/thor0215/hassio-xfinity-usage/)

2. Install the Xfinity Usage addon
3. Enter your username and password using the configuration page
4. If you are using MQTT, see the [MQTT Setup](#mqtt-setup) instructions below. If MQTT is enabled the addon will no longer update the default sensor.
5. After starting the addon, check the log for "INFO: Usage data retrieved and processed"
6. Now go to Developer tools -> States and search for sensor.xfinity_usage or for MQTT setups, sensor.xfinity_internet_usage

Addon Defaults: Page Timeout is 45 seconds and the script runs every 15 minutes (900 seconds)

### ***Known limitation for default sensor. This does not apply to MQTT setups.***

There is a known limitation that the sensor will be unavailable if you restart Home Assistant. This is caused by the way Home Assistant handles sensors which are not backed up by an entity, but instead come from an add-on or AppDaemon. You can easily fix that with the following blueprint:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https://github.com/thor0215/hassio-xfinity-usage/blob/main/blueprints/restore_xfinity_internet_usage_sensor.yaml)

Or use this automation directly:

```yaml
  alias: Restore Xfinity Internet Usage sensor on startup
  description: Restore Xfinity Internet Usage sensor on startup
  trigger:
    - platform: homeassistant
      event: start
  condition: []
  action:
    - service: hassio.addon_restart
      metadata: {}
      data:
        addon: 989f231b_xfinity-usage
  mode: single
```

## MQTT Setup

Enable MQTT and enter the MQTT Broker information and login if necessary. Note if you are using the Moquitto MQTT addon, the startup logs will show the necessary MQTT broker info like this

```text
